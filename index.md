## Getting Started

The [Event Inventory API](public-event-list.md) enables PatronManager clients to have maximum flexibility with their own site. The buyer is still directed out to the secure "force dot com" site to make their actual purchase, but the Event Inventory API is designed to allow calendar integration and other fancy search functions. 

The [glossary](glossary.md) defines terminology used throughout this site and PatronManager.

## Getting Started

The [event feed API](public-event-list.md) enables PatronManager clients to have maximum flexibility with their own site. The buyer is still directed out to the secure "force dot com" site to make their actual purchase, but the event feed is designed to allow calendar integration and other fancy search functions. 

The [glossary](glossary.md) defines terminology used throughout this site and PatronManager. 


Here are a few live sites that use the feed:
